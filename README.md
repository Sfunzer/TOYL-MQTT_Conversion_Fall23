The “ Thinking of You Light”  is an idea which in its global form is aimed at reducing the feeling of loneliness. The idea is simple: a friend 
or a relative can turn on the light from wherever they are over the world, and the recipient, or "light-keeper" knows someone is 
thinking about him or her because the light is on.
